        <p>Here's a campaign body. It's a very important part of any campaign.
          <strong>That's why we're calling on everyone to be a lot nicer to each other.</strong>
          Except to fascists.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>See we have to smash fascism. Sometimes the fascists will
          perceive this as being mean towards them, and we really can't do much about that.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>But what we <em>can do</em> is sign internet petitions. That'll show 'em!</p>
